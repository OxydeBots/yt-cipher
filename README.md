Basic service to eval yt player scripts for nsig stuff. 

# Getting Started

## Public instance
**It is very much reccomended to host yourself**

You can use the public instance without a password at `https://cipher.kikkia.dev/api`. 

WARNING: Ratelimit of 5/sec, also do not expect perfect uptime. To have better performance and garunteed uptime, host it yourself. 

## Hosting yourself

### Docker/Docker-compose

The easiest way to use this right now is with docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kikkia/yt-cipher.git

cd yt-cipher

git clone https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs.git

docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Deno

If you have Deno installed, you can run the service directly.

Clone the repository and patch the `ejs` dependency:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kikkia/yt-cipher.git
cd yt-cipher
git clone https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs.git
deno run --allow-read --allow-write ./scripts/patch-ejs.ts
```

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --v8-flags=--max-old-space-size=1024 server.ts
```

## Authentication

You can optionally set the `API_TOKEN` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file to require a password to access the service.

Requests without a valid `Authorization: <your_token>` header will be rejected if you have a token set.

## Config

Environment Variables:
- `MAX_THREADS` - max # of workers that can handle requests. Default is 1 per thread on the machine or 1 if it can't determine that for some reason. 
- `API_TOKEN` - The required token to authenticate requests
- `PORT` - Port to run the api on, default: `8001`
- `HOST` - Sets the hostname for the deno server, default: `0.0.0.0`

## IPv6 Support

To run the server with IPv6, you need to configure the `HOST` environment variable.

- Set `HOST` to `[::]` to bind to all available IPv6 and IPv4 addresses on most modern operating systems.

When accessing the service over IPv6, make sure to use the correct address format. For example, to access the service running on localhost, you would use `http://[::1]:8001/`.
